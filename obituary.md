# Scott, Sheila Anne (formerly Duncan)

On Tuesday May 23, 2023, Sheila had a peaceful and dignified passing in her home, surrounded by birds, music and the love of her close family and friends.  She was in her 77th year of living life with joy and grace.

Beloved and proud mother of Julian Duncan (Jennifer) and Anne Duncan Rastogi (Ravi).  Cherished Nana of Kayla, Heather and Ethan Duncan and Simon and Maya Rastogi.  Beloved sister of Clive Scott (Elisabeth) and Keith Scott (Elizabeth) and loving aunt of Christopher Scott (Lorna), Clive Scott (Mo) and Ashley Gardiner (Luke).

Sheila was born in Falkirk, Scotland on September 6, 1946, and lived through the challenges of post-war life in Scotland as the eldest sibling.  She enjoyed a happy childhood and spoke fondly of many family holidays spent swimming in the North Sea and in the south of England.  Her parents encouraged her to be well-educated and career-oriented and introduced her to many different arts and cultures.   Sheila worked hard in school and enjoyed learning French and German during summer exchanges and work opportunities in France and Switzerland.

Sheila graduated with a diploma in Secretarial Science with a Distinction in Languages from Strathclyde University in Glasgow, Scotland in 1966.   She enjoyed an interesting posting with the British Foreign Office in London, England and loved living with the “Putney Girls” in their London flat. She was an adventurous person and in 1965 and 1966 she travelled to Toronto, Canada for summer working holidays.  At the University of Toronto summer residence, she met her future husband, Ron Duncan and after a short time Sheila set sail for Canada to start a new married life in London, Ontario in 1969. They shared 21 years as a couple Morris dancing, Scottish Country dancing and participating in many Home County Folk Festivals and Pinewoods Dance Camps while working, raising two children and putting their love of nature into canoe trips and their cottage on Stony Lake.  Sheila and Ron parted ways in 1990 but remained amicable and shared many family events together over the years.

Sheila spent most of her career working as a Program Coordinator in Continuing Studies at Western University.  She organized many dance and cultural programs as well as large conferences and events.  She had excellent attention to special details to make the experiences effective and memorable for all.

Sheila was always “The Dancing Queen”.  She loved dancing all throughout her life participating with many different groups in London (international folk dance, historic Playford dancing, Scottish and English country dancing and Morris dancing) and she loved introducing her grandchildren to square dancing at Juniper Island on Stony Lake.  She was a gifted dance teacher and a sought-out caller for years of community dances.  She transferred this passion to her children and grandchildren through music lessons and support of their live performances.  She was also a huge lover of live theater, particularly the Stratford Festival.

Sheila was always a dedicated volunteer for many local organizations and loved to swim, cycle, walk, garden and cross-country ski.  She remained active as her dance endeavors slowed down and she found great pleasure in meeting new friends with the Thames Valley Trail Association, Nature London and the Stratford Field Naturalists.  She was always up for exploring a new ski trail in winter or a new forest path in the spring.  Summers were spent swimming and canoeing at her beloved Stony Lake.  The grandkids will always remember “tea on the dock” and many campfires and sing-a-longs by the lake with Nana.  Adults will remember “G and T’s” on the dock and leisurely swims to the Point. 

Sheila was certainly a “lover of life” and always took great interest in others sharing long phone conversations with close friends near and far.  She never missed an occasion to get together with friends or family and loved a good party.  Sheila was also a cat lover through and through and always had one or two pussy cats roaming around her house and garden.

Part of Sheila’s leukemia treatment involved frequent life-saving blood transfusions and she was very grateful to the army of blood donors.  Please consider contacting Canadian Blood Services and donating the gift of life or supporting the vital work they do with a donation.

Sheila wished to be remembered as she was in her healthy vibrant state.  Cremation has taken place and a Celebration of Life will occur in early July 2023.  The family would like to thank the wonderful care of the outpatient and inpatient Oncology staff at the London Regional Cancer Centre. Arrangements entrusted with Cremation London & Middlesex Inc, 519-858-2467. Online condolences shared at www.cremationlondon.com

Sheila would like her family and friends to remember:

For each thorn, there’s a rosebud..<br>
For each twilight – a dawn..<br>
For each trial – the strength to carry on..<br>
For each storm cloud – the sun..<br>
For each parting – sweet memories when sorrow is done.<br>
- Ralph Waldo Emerson
